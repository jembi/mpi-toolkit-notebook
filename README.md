The MPI toolkit gives health providers the ability to identify and link patient data together to gather a more comprehensive view of health care records. This tool allows the comparing of data from different health IT systems to determine whether data sources match and belong to the same entity in order to obtain a complete record of the patient's medical history.

This toolkit comprises of 3 components:

* Dataset Generator notebook
* Blocking notebook
* Fastlink Matching Process notebook
