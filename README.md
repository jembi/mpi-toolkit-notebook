The MPI toolkit gives health providers the ability to identify and link patient data together to gather a more comprehensive view of health care records. This tool allows the comparing of data from different health IT systems to determine whether data sources match and belong to the same entity in order to obtain a complete record of the patient's medical history.

This toolkit comprises of 3 components:

* Dataset Generator
* Blocking 
* Matching Process

> To learn more about patient matching and get a more comprehensive understanding of the key features mentioned above please see the full documentation. (add link here)

## Requirements

This 3-component tool has been developed in Google Colab notebooks using Python. Colab is a hosted Juypter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources.

Colab is a product from Google Research, therefore a Google account is required to use all three notebooks.
